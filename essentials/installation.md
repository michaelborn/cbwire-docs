# Installation

Install [CommandBox](https://www.ortussolutions.com/products/commandbox), then from your terminal, within the root of your project, run:

```bash
box install cbwire
```

If you want the latest ( bleeding edge ), run:

```bash
box install cbwire@be
```

That's it. Thank you[ Brad](https://twitter.com/bdw429s?lang=en)!:slight\_smile:&#x20;
